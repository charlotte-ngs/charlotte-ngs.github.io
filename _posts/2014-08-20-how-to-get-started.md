title: How To Get Started
---

Most Blogs start by a report on how to get started with blogging. This blog should not be any different. Not that it is particularly interesting, but maybe someone else out there has the same difficulties that I had and maybe these lines can help getting over those difficulties a little faster.

## History
Before coming here I started a blog using [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) linked to [Postach.io](http://postach.io). This was very convenient, because I use Evernote on an every day basis. When writing a post about some programming code and showing the output of that code which can be a number, a string, a table, or a diagram, the copy-paste solution became very tedious. Hence I was looking for something else.

## Goal
The goal for my new blogging environment was to write one source file with everything and then have some clever system produce all the output that was desired.
