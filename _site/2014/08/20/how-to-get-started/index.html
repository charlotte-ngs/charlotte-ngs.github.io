  <p>Most Blogs start by a report on how to get started with blogging. This blog should not be any different. Not that it is particularly interesting, but maybe someone else out there has the same difficulties that I had and maybe these lines can help getting over those difficulties a little faster.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Before coming here I started a blog using <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> linked to <a href="http://postach.io">Postach.io</a>. This was very convenient, because I use Evernote on a daily basis. When writing a post about programming concepts, I want to follow the paradigm of reproducible research or reproducible programming, i.e., no copy-pasting of code and results. Everything is produced by one single source file. At the time when I got started with my Evernote blog I did not see how to implement the strategy of reproducible programming. </p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the goal for my ideal blogging environment was to write one source file with everything and then have some clever system produce all the output that was desired. I was reading some blog posts about blogging like a hacker <code>reference needed here</code> and thereby I found using GitHub pages was what I wanted.</p>
