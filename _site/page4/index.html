    <p>When working with big data which is certainly the case in the area of
next generation sequencing (NGS), it is important to have a set of tools 
or a system that supports the user in managing and analysing the available 
data. </p>

<h2>The R System</h2>

<p>In statistical data analysis <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> has become very 
popular. The philosophy of R is similar to the one of Unix of building a system 
using small tools. Hence the base of R is relatively small. But that small base 
can easily be extended by a large number of packages. The Comprehensive R Archive 
Network <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> is the main repository for packages 
extending the functionality of the R system.</p>

<h2>Bioconductor</h2>

<p>When working with data from Bio- or Life-Sciences, <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> 
is a very valuable resource. Bioconductor does not only provide a large set of 
R packages but it does also offer standardized workflows and example datasets. 
In general Bioconductor documentation is provided by vignettes following the 
paradigm of reproducible research.</p>

<h2>Why R</h2>

<p>Because first of all R is very fast in prototyping and second R is easy to extend 
either by writing packages in R or by using its interfaces to other languages. </p>

<p>Dirk Edelbuettel explained why to use R in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZkaZhsOfT4">Google Tech Talk</a></p>

<h2>R Crash Course</h2>

<p>Learning how to use a system like R is associated with a certain learning curve. 
Some people pretend that this curve is especially steep when learning how to use R. </p>

<p>As an introduction, I have put together some slides which I would use to introduce 
R to an audience without prior knowledge. In case you are interested you can <a href="http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/RCrashCourse">read more
