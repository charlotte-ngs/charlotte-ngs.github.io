# Charlotte-NGS

*Charlotte-NGS* is designed to be a platform for projects on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).
People who are interested in NGS and would like to contribute something are welcome to join 
the Charlotte-NGS team. Please send email to ngs.charlotte@gmail.com

-----

Current members of the Charlotte-NGS team are primarily involved with the analysis of NGS 
data and not so much with the wet-lab part of NGS. Hence the main focus of Charlotte-NGS is 
on analysing NGS data.
