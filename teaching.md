This page links to courses that I helped teaching. Students who are lost can always get to their respective course site. So far most of the material is in German, but this is hopefully going to change soon. 

### Courses
- Spring 2016: [Genetic Evaluation and Applied Statistical Methods](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/GELASM/)
- Fall 2015: [Livestock Breeding and Genomics](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/LivestockBreedingAndGenomics)
