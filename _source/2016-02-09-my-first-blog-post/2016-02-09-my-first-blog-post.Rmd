### My own stuff comes here 
Here is some text before showning a little plot. Let us change something, to check what happens.

The following plot is not working so far.

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```

Try some other R chunks here 

```{r}
cat("hello world!")
```

Yet another chunk of R code

```{r}
set.seed(123)
(x = rnorm(20) + 10)
```

This is the end of our post.
